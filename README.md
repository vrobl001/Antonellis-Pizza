# Antonellis-Pizza
An app that allows users to browse through the store's menu. Users with admin ability will be able to perform full CRUD functions on the inventory.

## Introduction

This app was built to simulate a website for customers to shop. Customers will be able to browse the menu and edit their own personal info, however, only an admin will be able to update the database.
